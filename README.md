# Breast Cancer Data Analysis

This project aims to analyze the breast cancer data set and use different machine learning models to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

## Project description

In this project, the breast cancer dataset provided by Scikit-learn is used to perform exploratory analysis on the data, create classification models using algorithms such as K Neighbors Classifier, Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Gaussian Naive Bayes, and evaluate the effectiveness of these models through cross-validation.

In addition, the hyperparameters of the models are adjusted to increase the accuracy of the predictions and a correlation analysis is performed between the different characteristics of the data set.
  
## Results and conclusions

The results show that the K Neighbors Classifier model obtains an average accuracy of 93.5%, followed by the SVC model with an average accuracy of 91.92% and Gaussian Naive Bayes with an average accuracy of 93.85%. It is observed that tuning the hyperparameters of the K Neighbors Classifier model can significantly improve its performance.

Correlation analysis reveals that certain features of the data set are highly correlated, which can be useful in selecting the most relevant features in future models.

In summary, this project demonstrates my ability to perform data analysis, implement machine learning models, and draw meaningful conclusions from the results.
